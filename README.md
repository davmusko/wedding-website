Final version of David and Jelena's wedding website. This design was taken from Jonas Schmedtmann's 'Advanced CSS and Sass: Flexbox, Grid, Animations and More!' course on 'udemy.com'. It is based off a example site called, 'Natours'. This design was requested by the couple and was coded by just using the original site as mockup. This design was created with premission of the original creator. No copyright infringement was intented and this site will not be used to generate revenue. This website was created by David Musko, pro bono, for his life long friend and may be used for his portfolio.
